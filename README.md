Dataset Generation-
      Every second of video is captured as frames. Duplicated frames are deleted.
      Then, faces are detected from frames. Dataset is generated by data augmentation (50 images of each sample).
Training-
      Secondly, we have trained and used LBPH algorithm for our recognizer and a file is saved for each of the samples. 
Detection-
      Lastly, we detected by opening webcam again. It matches the present image with the trained recognizer and corresponding sample id. It can also be done videos which will help in recognizing the criminal face in vedios corresponding to previous video.
